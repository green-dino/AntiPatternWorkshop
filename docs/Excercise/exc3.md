# Exercise 3 Action Planning Session

## Objective 
The objective of this activity is to help participants develop
a corrective plan for addressing selected anti-patterns identified in the
previous exercises. This exercise will enable them to create an actionable
strategy for mitigating the negative impacts of anti-patterns on their
organization's performance.

## Duration 90 minutes

## Materials Required
1. Whiteboard or a flipchart
2. Markers or pens
3. A list of selected anti-patterns from previous exercises
4. Sticky notes or index cards for each participant
5. Timer
6. Worksheets for recording the corrective plans (provided by the
facilitator)

## Instructions
1. The facilitator will introduce the concept of developing a corrective
plan for addressing selected anti-patterns and provide examples of some
commonly observed ones, such as "Gold Plating," "Analysis Paralysis," and
"Silos."
2. Participants will be asked to select one anti-pattern from the list
provided by the facilitator that they believe is most relevant to their
organization's context and has a high severity and urgency rating.
3. Participants will then be asked to brainstorm potential corrective
actions for addressing this selected anti-pattern, writing them on sticky
notes or index cards.
4. After all participants have completed this activity, they will be asked
to categorize these corrective actions based on their feasibility and
effectiveness using a matrix, with one axis representing feasibility
(easy, moderate, complex) and the other axis representing effectiveness
(low, medium, high).
5. Participants will then be asked to select three corrective actions that
they believe are most feasible and effective for addressing the selected
anti-pattern.
6. Participants will be provided with worksheets to record their selected
corrective actions, including a detailed description of each action, the
responsible person, the expected outcomes, the timeline, and any potential
challenges or dependencies.
7. After all participants have completed this exercise, they will be asked
to share their selected corrective plans in small groups, discussing their
feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation strategy.
8. The facilitator will then facilitate a discussion among the
participants on how these corrective actions can be implemented
effectively, highlighting the importance of addressing anti-patterns
promptly to prevent negative impacts on the organization's performance.

## Benefits
1. Helps participants develop a feasible and effective corrective plan for
addressing selected anti-patterns identified in previous exercises.
2. Encourages participants to select corrective actions that are both
feasible and effective, ensuring implementation success.
3. Facilitates a discussion among the participants on how these corrective
actions can be implemented effectively, emphasizing the importance of
prompt action for mitigating negative impacts on the organization's
performance.
4. Provides participants with an actionable strategy for addressing
anti-patterns, empowering them to take proactive steps towards improving
their organization's overall performance.
