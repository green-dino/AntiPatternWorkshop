patterns, highlighting how they manifested in their organizations and the
impact they had on productivity, efficiency, or customer satisfaction.

business anti-patterns and ask them to select three that they believe are
most relevant to their organization's context.

sticky notes or index cards provided, along with their impact on the
organization's productivity, efficiency, financial, operational, or
reputational performance.
5. After all participants have shared their selected anti-patterns, the
facilitator will ask them to stick these notes onto the whiteboard or
flipchart, categorizing them based on their impact and urgency.
6. The facilitator will then facilitate a discussion among the
participants, encouraging them to share their insights into how these
patterns manifested in their organizations, why they occurred, and what
steps could be taken to address them effectively.

learnings from the activity and highlighting the importance of addressing
anti-patterns promptly to prevent negative impacts on the organization's
