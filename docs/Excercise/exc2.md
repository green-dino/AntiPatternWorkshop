# Excercise 2 Prioritization Exercise 

## Materials Required
1. Whiteboard or a flipchart
2. Markers or pens
3. A list of common business anti-patterns (provided by the facilitator)
4. Sticky notes or index cards for each participant
5. Timer

## Instructions
1. The facilitator will introduce the concept of prioritizing business
anti-patterns and provide examples of some commonly observed ones, such as
"Gold Plating," "Analysis Paralysis," and "Silos."
2. Participants will be asked to select three anti-patterns from the list
provided by the facilitator that they believe are most relevant to their
organization's context.
3. Participants will then be asked to write these selected anti-patterns
on sticky notes or index cards and categorize them based on their severity
and urgency using a matrix, with one axis representing severity (low,
medium, high) and the other axis representing urgency (immediate, short
term, long term).
4. After all participants have completed this activity, they will be asked
to stick these notes onto the whiteboard or flipchart, discussing their
prioritization decisions in small groups.
5. The facilitator will then facilitate a discussion among the
participants on why certain anti-patterns were given higher priority than
others, highlighting the importance of evaluating both severity and
urgency when making such decisions.
6. The session will conclude with the facilitator summarizing the key
learnings from the activity and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing
business anti-patterns based on their impact and urgency to ensure
effective resource allocation and mitigate negative impacts on the
organization's performance.

## Benefits

2. Encourages participants to prioritize anti-patterns based on their
impact and urgency, ensuring effective resource allocation.
3. Facilitates a discussion among the participants on why certain
anti-patterns were given higher priority than others.
4. Highlights the importance of addressing high severity and urgency
anti-patterns promptly to prevent negative impacts on the organization's
performance.
