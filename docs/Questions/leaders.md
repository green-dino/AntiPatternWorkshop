# Leadership Questions 

Reflective Questions (Leaders)

1. Are we communicating effectively both within our team and across
different departments? If not, what steps can we take to improve
communication and collaboration?

2. Do we have inefficient processes or workflows that are holding us back?
What opportunities exist for streamlining these processes, eliminating
redundancies, and improving overall efficiency?

3. Are we duplicating effort unnecessarily? How can we ensure that tasks
are being performed efficiently and effectively without wasting resources
or time?

4. Do we have a tendency to resist change or be resistant to learning new
skills and knowledge? What steps can we take to embrace innovation,
flexibility, and agility as an organization?

5. Are we too reliant on specific individuals for critical tasks,
knowledge, or expertise? How can we develop redundancy and depth in our
talent pool to ensure continuity of service if key personnel leave or
become unavailable?
